So here we are..time has come for a new development laptop that I can carry on the go! Even though i wasn't ready for 
this, I was *forced* to take this step by...an unfortunate event 

### BEFORE
My old machine was a Dell XPS 15 9550 (2017) 
Specs: 
* CPU: Intel i7-6770hq
* RAM: 16GB
* SSD: 512GB NVMe
* DISPLAY: 1920x1080 IPS
* BATTERY: 84Wh
* US KEYBOARD LAYOUT

This was the **beast** I choose for myself, it came directly from the manifacturer (first time in my life, I 
was used to go to a shop and buy whatever they had available) because I had the chance to choose the components through
the Dell website (I know this might sound exaggerated but in my country this is rare and most of the time not all the 
hardware combinations are available, more on this later!). 

It was my dream machine, choosing the FHD display even though 4k was already available gave me 7/8h of battery life 
(compared to 4/5h of the 4k model), going for the more expensive NVMe (instead of SATA drive) gave me increased 
performance and allowed me to choose the bigger battery capacity (if you were to choose the SATA model a mere 56Wh 
battery was used). Lastly the keyboard layout made my life easier when programming since my "native" layout requires 
strange key combinations for the brakets or completely lacks the **~** (tilde).

During its honorable life I managed to max out RAM to 32GB, upgrade the SSD drive with a blazing fast 1TB NVMe. To give
a reference point I was able to open 2 separate 8GB RAM Virtual Machines (VM), having 30/40 Firefox tabs open, 7 or 8
docker containers running in the background and many other background processes without breaking a sweat. All this was 
happening on my trusty OpenSuse Tumbleweed, with no issues with the infamous Nvidia card (that caused me many headache 
in the past).

Of course it had its problems, since I had to completely replace the keyboard and bezel because the former became 
unresponsive and the latter sticky (Yeah the soft-touch-carbon looks cool at the beginning but it becomes sticky and i was a dirt magnet, 
going on field with customers and that dirty laptop made me feel ashamed more than once) and the battery was replaced
since it had <50% of the initial capacity.

All in all I was happy with that laptop, it probably would have lasted for another couple of years and, as you can tell, 
I'm still grieving...But it's time to move on!

### The choice
So here I am, on the market for a new developer laptop! Here are some criterias I've considered:
* Weight: < 1.5kg
* Display: 13"-14" MATTE
* Diplay Resolution: < 1920 px wide (if possible 16:10 screen ratio, eg. 1920x1200)
* Battery: > 7h 
* Disk: NVMe >= 512Gb
* RAM: > 16Gb
* Ports: At least 1 Thunderbolt
* Charging through Thunderbolt, ideally using 65W Power Deliver (PD) charger
* Decent keyboard, ideally US-layout
* NO dedicated graphics card

Another decisive factor would be availabilty within 1 week. This didn't play well with the recent silicon shortage and
made the range of choice already very tight.

So i went online for a *quick* check and found these candidates:
### Candidates (part 1)
#### LENOVO T14s Gen 2
It ticked most of the boxes:
+ Legendary keyboard and sturdiness (with us-layout too!)
+ Full HD Display (although not 16:10)  with optional 500nits (+touch)
+ 32Gb RAM (although soldered :( )
+ 2x Thunderbolt + 2x USB 3.2 + HDMI
+ Integrated Intel IRIS graphics
+ Latest gen (11th) Intel i7 CPU
+ 1.26 kg

The cons? Availability in **more than 6 weeks** 

#### LENOVO T14 Gen 2
Very similar to the previous one, but:
+ slightly heavier (1.46 kg) and thicker
+ 16Gb soldered RAM + available DIMM slot (up to 48Gb!)
+ Same display although 500nits upgrade not available

Still same problem...**more than 6 weeks** to be delivered

#### DELL XPS 13
Well...this was the first one I went to look for, probably because of the good results of the previous one? 
It was ideal for many reasons:
* Good build quality
* Extremely thin and light (1.20 kg!)
* 1920x1200 500nit diplay (16:10 finally!)
* 2x Thunderbolt (although no other ports are available)
* Latest gen (11th) Intel i7 CPU
+ Integrated Intel IRIS graphics

But it had some problems too:
* Soldered 16Gb RAM **MAX**
* The same old black-carbon-soft-touch-will-become-sticky bezel (although the white version, not available in my country
 shouldn't have this problem)
* Shipping after **more than 20 days**  (and last time it was from China and it took 2 weeks to get here)

Desperate about the super slow shipping time i went to some local shops and called some local dealers and found
these laptops:
### Candidates (Part 2)
#### DELL 9420
This was an unexpected find, since it's a relatively newer model and there aren't so many reviews on the web.
It apparently exists in 2 variants: laptop and 2in1. I went straight for the laptop model since for my job it's completely 
useless to have a touch screen and I suspect the screen would be more wobbly (it's very annoying while travelling)

Main PROs:
* Good build quality
* 1920x1200 IPS Display (16:10 yay!)
* 2x Thunderbolt 4 + 1x USB-A 3.2 + HDMI
* Latest gen (11th) Intel i7 CPU
* 32Gb RAM (although soldered :( )
* Integrated Intel IRIS graphics
* Readily Available
Drawbacks:
* Non US (Italian) layout

#### MSI Prestige 14
This was a lucky find from a local shop, with the lowest price of the group but still with:
* Stylish appearance (although made of plastic with some aluminium inserts)
* Very light (1.25 kg)
* 2x Thunderbolt 4
* Good FullHD Display (later I discovered it's a very low power model, 1.2W MAX which should help with battery life)
* Readily Available 
* Unconventional keyboard layout, basically ANSI with accented characters (see pic)
* Integrated Intel IRIS graphics

Drawbacks:
* 16GB soldered RAM
* 1x USB-A 2.0 (yes, it's not a mistake...USB2.0 and it's the only USB-A available)
